<p>This video basically is telling about where the fast food was invented and also who invented it. Firstly people used to eat at home but after some time they started eating out. In 1948 <b>IN-N-OUT</b> burger was the first one to start working in Los Angeles, California with the drive thru option in just 10ft square restaurant. Later in 1952 <b>KFC</b> started working in <b>Salt Lake City, Utah</b>, afterwards we have <b>Burger King</b> starting in 1954 in <b>Florida</b> and in the end the <b>Pizza Hut</b> in 1958 in <b>Whichita, Kansas</b>. With time a lot more fast food brands were relased like <b>Wendy's, Mc Donald's, Dominos Pizza</b> etc. Year <b>1978</b> was the year when in USA the number of fast food resturants was around <b>60.000</b>. The brands didn't stop opening their restuarants just in USA, they started going worldwide and that happened in the 90s when the first outlet used to be opened in the capital city of <b>Russia, Moscow.</b>. However, nowadays you can find the most popular fast food brands all over the world without problem and it's just same taste like eating in the restuarants that are in the USA.</p>
